# Plain Blog

The Plain Blog builder which emits zero client-side JavaScript.

Write content in a modern way with MD/MDX/JSX, but send no JavaScript to the client-side.

It's fast, both at run time and build time, and it's simple, thanks to Node.js [module hooks](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/module.html#customization-hooks), as known as *node loaders*.
